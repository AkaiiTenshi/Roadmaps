# THE ULTIMATE PYTHON MASTERY & CYBERSECURITY ROADMAP
# Schedule: 6-8 Hours Per Day | Duration: 6+ Months

## DAILY DISCIPLINE (The 8-Hour Rule)
- 09:00 - 11:00: Theory & Reading (Fluent Python / Black Hat Python)
- 11:00 - 14:00: Active Coding (Building tools and automation scripts)
- 14:00 - 15:00: Break
- 15:00 - 17:00: Security Labs (Applying scripts to HackTheBox or TryHackMe)
- 17:00 - 18:00: Code Optimization (Refactoring for speed and PEP 8 standards)

---

## PHASE 1: AUTOMATION & SCRIPTING FUNDAMENTALS (Month 1)
Goal: Master Python syntax and the ability to manipulate the OS and File System.

### Project 1.1: The Intelligent Log Parser
- Features: Scan massive server log files (.log) for specific error codes or suspicious IP addresses.
- Requirements: Use sys.argv, file I/O, and string manipulation.
- Goal: Mastery of the "os" and "sys" libraries.

### Project 1.2: The Directory Watchdog
- Features: Monitor a specific folder and alert the user if any files are created, modified, or deleted.
- Requirements: Use the 'watchdog' library or simple time-based polling.
- Goal: Understanding event-driven programming.

### Project 1.3: Multi-Threaded Port Scanner
- Features: Scan a range of IP addresses to find open ports (80, 443, 22, etc.).
- Requirements: Use the 'socket' library and 'threading' for speed.
- Goal: Understanding the speed difference between sequential and concurrent code.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Automated Backup & Encryptor
- Features: Zip a directory, encrypt it using AES, and "upload" it to a local server or cloud.
- Requirements: Use 'zipfile' and 'cryptography' libraries.
- Goal: Combining file handling with high-level encryption APIs.

---

## PHASE 2: NETWORK PROTOCOLS & SCRAPING (Month 2)
Goal: Interact with the web and forged packets.



### Project 2.1: The Custom Web Scraper
- Features: Extract all links, emails, and metadata from a target website.
- Requirements: Use 'BeautifulSoup' and 'requests'.
- Goal: Mastery of HTML parsing and HTTP methods (GET/POST).

### Project 2.2: The Arp Spoofer (MITM)
- Features: Redirect traffic on a local network to flow through your machine.
- Requirements: Use the 'scapy' library to forge ARP packets.
- Security Value: Understanding how "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks function.

### Project 2.3: Packet Sniffer & Analyzer
- Features: Capture live network traffic and filter for sensitive data like cleartext passwords.
- Requirements: Use 'scapy' or 'pcap' bindings.
- Goal: Visualizing the OSI model in real-time.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Vulnerability Scanner (Web)
- Features: Automatically test a URL for common flaws like SQL Injection or XSS.
- Requirements: Use 'requests' to inject payloads and check for specific reflections in the HTML.
- Goal: Automating the manual pentesting process.

---

## PHASE 3: OFFENSIVE TOOLING & EXPLOIT DEV (Months 3-4)
Goal: Building tools that interact with binaries and remote systems.

### Project 3.1: The Python-Based Reverse Shell
- Features: A script that, when executed on a target, connects back to your machine to give you a terminal.
- Requirements: Use 'subprocess' and 'socket'.
- Security Value: The standard payload for successful exploits.

### Project 3.2: Brute-Force Suite
- Features: Attempt to crack SSH, FTP, or Zip file passwords using wordlists.
- Requirements: Use 'paramiko' (for SSH) or 'ftplib'. 
- Goal: Handling authentication protocols and dictionary attacks.

### Project 3.3: C-Types & DLL Injector
- Features: Use Python to call functions in a C-compiled DLL or shared object (.so).
- Requirements: Use the 'ctypes' library.
- Goal: Interfacing Python with low-level system memory.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Command & Control (C2) Framework
- Features: A central server that can send commands to multiple "agents" installed on target machines.
- Requirements: Flask/FastAPI for the server, 'requests' for agents.
- Goal: Managing persistent access and remote administration.

---

## PHASE 4: ADVANCED DEFENSE & MALWARE ANALYSIS (Month 5+)
Goal: Using Python to catch the "bad guys."

### Project 4.1: Static Malware Analyzer
- Features: Take a suspicious .exe or ELF and extract strings, headers, and entropy scores.
- Requirements: Use 'pefile' or 'elftools'.
- Goal: Automating the first step of Malware Analysis.

### Project 4.2: AI-Powered Phishing Detector
- Features: Analyze an email's text and URL to determine the probability that it is a phishing attempt.
- Requirements: Use 'scikit-learn' or simple 'regex' pattern matching.
- Goal: Introduction to "Security Data Science."

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Custom Endpoint Detection (EDR) Agent
- Features: A background process that monitors running processes and kills them if they attempt "illegal" actions (like editing system files).
- Requirements: Use 'psutil' and 'win32api' (or Linux equivalent).
- Security Value: Building a defensive shield from scratch.
