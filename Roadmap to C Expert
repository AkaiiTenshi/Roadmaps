# Schedule: 6-8 Hours Per Day | Duration: 6+ Months

## DAILY DISCIPLINE (The 8-Hour Rule)
- 09:00 - 11:00: Theory & Reading (K&R C or Linux Programming Interface)
- 11:00 - 14:00: Active Coding (Projects)
- 14:00 - 15:00: Break
- 15:00 - 17:00: Debugging & Analysis (GDB, Valgrind, Objdump)
- 17:00 - 18:00: Binary Literacy (Reading Hex/Assembly)

---

## PHASE 1: LOGIC & THE BIT-LEVEL (Month 1)
Goal: Master syntax and data representation. Understand memory as numbers.

### Project 1.1: The Unit Converter
- Features: Temperature, Weight, and Currency conversion.
- Requirements: Use scanf, if/else, and while loops. Handle invalid input (letters instead of numbers).
- Goal: Input validation.

### Project 1.2: The Hex-Looker
- Features: Input a character/number; output Decimal, Hex, and Binary.
- Requirements: Use bitwise operators (&, |, >>) for binary calculation.
- Goal: Understanding raw data.

### Project 1.3: The Hex-Dump Utility
- Features: Create a tool that reads any file and prints the raw hex.
- Requirements: 16-byte buffer, Offset counter, ASCII representation column.
- Security Value: Essential for analyzing "magic bytes" in file headers.

### Project 1.4: XOR Cipher Tool
- Features: Read a file, XOR every byte with a key, save to new file.
- Requirements: File I/O (fopen, fgetc, fputc).
- Goal: Basic obfuscation.
- Security Value: This is how 90% of basic malware hides its strings.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Math Parser
- Features: Calculate strings like "(5 + 3) * 2".
- Requirements: Implement the Shunting-Yard Algorithm.
- Goal: Logic parsing and stack management.

## PHASE 2: MEMORY & POINTER MASTERY (Month 2)
Goal: Total control of the Heap. Learn why C is dangerous.

### Project 2.1: The Custom String Library
- Features: Re-code the string.h libraby. (e.g:strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp)
- Requirements: No array brackets []. Use only Pointer Arithmetic.
- Goal: Preventing Buffer Overflows.
- Security Value: You must learn exactly where the "Null Terminator" is to know how to overflow it.

### Project 2.2: The Dynamic Database
- Features: Add/Delete/Search entries. Save to a binary file.
- Requirements: Structs and malloc/free.
- Goal: Heap management.

### Project 2.3: The Leak Hunter
- Features: A wrapper for malloc that logs every allocation.
- Requirements: Create a __wrap_malloc.
- Goal: Detecting "Use-After-Free" bugs.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: Memory Arena Allocator
- Features: Request 10MB from OS; manage it with your own my_alloc() and my_free().
- Requirements: Implementing a "linked list" within the memory block.
- Goal: Systems-level memory architecture.
- Security Value: Understanding how the Heap works is required for "Heap Spraying" attacks.

---

## PHASE 3: SYSTEMS & THE KERNEL (Months 3-4)
Goal: Controlling the OS. Everything is a file.

### Project 3.1: The 'ls' Clone
- Features: List files with permissions, UID, and size.
- Requirements: Use <stat.h> and <dirent.h>.
- Goal: Understanding Linux permissions and Privilege Escalation (Finding files with SUID bits).
- Security Value: Privilege Escalation (Finding files with SUID bits).

### Project 3.2: The Pro-Shell
- Features: Redirection (>), Pipes (|), and Signals (Ctrl+C).
- Requirements: fork(), execve(), waitpid(), pipe(), dup2().
- Goal: Process Lifecycle & IPC.
- Security Value: The foundation of a "Reverse Shell" payload.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: Concurrent Web Server
- Features: Serve HTML/Images to a browser. Handle 100+ users.
- Requirements: Sockets (<sys/socket.h>) and pthreads.
- Goal: Network Protocols & Concurrency.
- Security Value: Understanding the Network Stack and "Race Conditions."

---

## PHASE 4: THE SECURITY TIER (Months 5+)
Goal: Offensive Programming. Breaking the Binary.

### Project 4.1: ELF Header Parser
- Features: Read a binary file; find the Entry Point and Sections.
- Requirements: Understand the ELF structure, parse the `Elf64_Ehdr` and `Elf64_Shdr` structures.
- Goal: Reverse Engineering.
- Security Value: Finding the "Global Offset Table" (GOT) for hijacking.

### Project 4.2: The Buffer Lab
- Features: Write a vulnerable program; write a script to hijack its execution.
- Requirements: Stack smashing and Return Address overwriting (print adress or use gdb).
- Goal: Exploit Development.
- Security Value: Crafting your first functional exploit.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: The Binary Packer/Crypter
- Features: Encrypt an .exe; create a 'stub' that decrypts it into RAM and runs it.
- Requirements: AES implementation + Memory Injection (mmap). Use `AES`, `mmap`, and `ptrace`
- Security Value / Goal: Bypassing Antivirus/EDR.
