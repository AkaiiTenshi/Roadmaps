# THE ULTIMATE ZIG MASTERY & CYBERSECURITY ROADMAP
# Schedule: 6-8 Hours Per Day | Duration: 6+ Months

## DAILY DISCIPLINE (The 8-Hour Rule)
- 09:00 - 11:00: Theory & Language Specs (Zig Guide / Zig Learn / Documentation)
- 11:00 - 14:00: Active Coding (Writing memory-safe low-level tools)
- 14:00 - 15:00: Break
- 15:00 - 17:00: Comptime Experimentation (Using Zig’s unique "Code as Data" features)
- 17:00 - 18:00: C-Interop (Importing C headers into Zig and analyzing the result)

## PHASE 1: NO HIDDEN CONTROL FLOW (Month 1)
Goal: Understand Zig’s philosophy: No hidden memory allocations and no hidden control flow.

### Project 1.1: The Error-Aware File Utility
- Features: A tool that copies or moves files while explicitly handling every possible error (Disk Full, Permission Denied, etc.).
- Requirements: Use Zig’s `try`, `catch`, and `errdefer` keywords.
- Goal: Mastery of Zig’s explicit error handling.

### Project 1.2: Struct-Level Memory Alignment Tool
- Features: Create various structs and print their size and the padding added by the compiler.
- Requirements: Use `@alignOf` and `@sizeOf`.
- Goal: Understanding how Zig optimizes memory layout compared to C.

### Project 1.3: Zig-Based Hex Dump (Enhanced)
- Features: A high-speed hex dump utility using Zig's standard library.
- Requirements: Use `std.fs` and `std.io`.
- Goal: Comparing Zig’s `std` library performance to the C version you built previously.

### 🏆 FINAL PROJECT: Custom Base64 Encoder/Decoder
- Features: A CLI tool to encode and decode strings/files in Base64.
- Requirements: Implement the logic using bit-shifting without external libraries.
- Goal: Understanding Zig’s "Slices" and "Arrays."

## PHASE 2: COMPTIME & METAPROGRAMMING (Month 2)
Goal: Master `comptime`—Zig’s ability to run code at compile time to create highly optimized binaries.

### Project 2.1: The Generic "Safe" Stack
- Features: Create a Stack data structure that works for any data type but checks for overflows at compile time.
- Requirements:
